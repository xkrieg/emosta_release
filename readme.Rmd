#                   EmoReader  

The Emosta EmoReader is a deep learning algorithm trained to read a photographed image of a human face and return the probability percentages of that face displaying each of Ekmanâ€™s (1972: 1973) seven emotional expressions: anger, contempt, disgust, fear, happiness, sadness, and surprise. (Neutral expressions are also coded.)  

Our software is designed to assist counselors, coaches, and HR professionals gain *deeper insight* and *direct feedback* from the interactions they have with their coworkers. The EmoReader supports multiple cameras and multiple faces, making it one of the only software options for capturing emotion in group settings. Please be sure to check out the User Guide and Interpretation Manual for more information.
